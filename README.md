# Simul / Unity

Simul projects for Unity

This repository contains the Unity integration for Simul trueSKY. It is organized so that each repo branch represents a major Unity version. The branches are intended to work with multiple trueSKY versions, and the plugin detects the trueSKY version at runtime.
